This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
You will also need to host your own version of the IMDB database found here - https://datasets.imdbws.com/ and repoint the mysql server details.
